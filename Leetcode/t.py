he author pre-test their algorithm on dataset with small scale, then choose the one has best performance to experiment on full dataset. I reckon this is a good strategy because it can save much time. Additionally, the author filters some obviously impossible blending words such as the words with too many continuously repeating character, this measure is important because it also can save much time. Finally, the comparision between different methods on different experiment are sufficient. \
